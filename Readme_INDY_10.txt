INDY 10 CLIENT SERVER DEMO
-----------------------------

* use SVN to download the latest code version  
* working with INDY 10 - DELPHI 2010, XE , DELPHI XE 2   
* a demo project on source forge 


Note #6 July 2012
-------------------
It is not GENERIC or INDY !!!   I did not read the INDY instruction in detail and recognize
the VCL is NOT TREAD SAFE!!!   This is well known.
Please remove all VCL command in my server.execute sample  -> this is the correct way !!!! 
If I find a time slot I will change also the sample 



Note #5 June 2012
-------------------
Please use only the NO GENRIC SAMPLES in your own application- Guess still something is wrong with GENERICS
and INDY. We will solve that issue now! 





Note #4 April 2012
-------------------

meanwhile lot of new samples are added, only sample #3 (complex demo keeps me in trouble)
pls. post some notes in the forum about future code improvements ...
did someone get sample 3 running ... pls. leave a note 


Note #3   March 2012
----------------------
01.03.2012 :
I crashed the SVN , now I did a reset of the complete repository ,
Load old file with bugs, revision < 75   or wait for upload of the new ones 
06.03.2012 : Upload of new code is ongoing ... please come back for final version of demo code 



Note #2  NOVEMBER 2011 
-------------------------

some code has been lost , try to recover to missing stuff
evaluate DELPHI XE2 x64 programs with INDY 10

if there is no better place on the web for INDY10 TCP Server demo code,
still looking for people willing to support the demo projects 


Note #1  18.03.2011
--------------------------

this is not the latest code base, sorry , latest one is on source forge-SVN file section 



Note #0  18.09.2010
--------------------------

the *.zip file with all the code is no longer distributed 
use SVN & tortoise instead of it
